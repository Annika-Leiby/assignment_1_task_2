# objective is to perform PCA, create a biplot, and interpret the results

#A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) that helps the audience understand the data (include a citation as necessary) and what youâ€™ll be exploring
#All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages suppressed) you wrote to wrangle data then run PCA, and to create a professional looking PCA biplot that appears (with a caption) in your knitted HTML
#A brief summary (nicely formatted and professionally written bulletpoints are fine) highlighting some major takeaways from your PCA that can be gleaned from the biplot

```

#This assignment will complete a PCA analysis, create a biplot, and interpret the PCA and biplot findings on environmental and climate data at the country level. The data comesfrom Google Earth Engine and can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/zanderventer/environmental-variables-for-world-countries/data.

# As the axis shows PC1 accounts for ~38.68% variance and PC2 accounts for ~30.44%. The total variance accounted by the first two PC is 69.12%. 

# Mean anual rainfall and tree canopy cover are strongly correlated since the arrows are almost at the same angle.
# Slope and elevation are also fairly strongly correlated.
# Wind, slope, and elevation are correlated but not very strongly.
